# Laravel CMS Project

A backend-driven CMS built with Laravel 8, featuring page, media, and team management. Includes both an admin panel and an API for a headless CMS setup.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 
- Composer
- MySQL or another database supported by Laravel
- Laravel 8.x

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the project dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure the environment

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set your database connection and other environment settings in the `.env` file.

### 4. Generate the application key

Run the following command to generate an application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Set up the database

Make sure your database is set up correctly. If you're using MySQL, update the `.env` file with the correct credentials.

Create the database and run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Install storage symlink (for media storage)

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This will create a symbolic link to the storage folder for public access to uploaded media.

### 7. Seed the database (optional)

If you want to seed the database with sample data, you can run:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### 8. Start the development server

Now you can start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API

For API endpoints, use Postman or another API client to interact with the endpoints, such as:

- `/api/pages`
- `/api/media`
- `/api/team`

### Authentication

If the project requires authentication for API access, you may need to implement token-based authentication (JWT or Laravel Passport). Follow the relevant instructions when that feature is ready.
